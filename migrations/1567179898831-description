This query will create a second table in the lab14_normal database named bookshelves
CREATE TABLE BOOKSHELVES (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(255));

This query will use a simple subquery to retrieve unique bookshelf values from the books table and insert each one into the bookshelves table in the name column
INSERT INTO bookshelves(name) SELECT DISTINCT bookshelf FROM books;

This query will add a column to the books table named bookshelf_id. This will connect each book to a specific bookshelf in the other table.
ALTER TABLE books ADD COLUMN bookshelf_id INT;

This query will prepare a connection between the two tables.
UPDATE books SET bookshelf_id=shelf.id FROM (SELECT * FROM bookshelves) AS shelf WHERE books.bookshelf = shelf.name;

This query will modify the books table by removing the column named bookshelf.
ALTER TABLE books DROP COLUMN bookshelf;

This query will modify the data type of the bookshelf_id in the books table, setting it as a foreign key which references the primary key in the bookshelves table. Now PostgreSQL knows HOW these 2 tables are connected.
ALTER TABLE books ADD CONSTRAINT fk_bookshelves FOREIGN KEY (bookshelf_id) REFERENCES bookshelves(id);
